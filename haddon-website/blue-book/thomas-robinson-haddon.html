  <p>Thomas Robinson Haddon, 1840-1914, the founder of the South African family of the Haddons, was a man of exceptional character. He was noted throughout a large circle of friends in Natal and the Transvaal for his refinement, culture and high ideals. It would not be an exaggeration to say that few men have exercised a greater moral influence upon their own circle, and retained throughout a long life such a measure of the unqualified love and admiration of their children and grandchildren. He had nine children, seven of whom and twenty-two grandchildren were living in South Africa at the time of his death on 28th September, 1914.</p>

  <p>Thomas Robinson Haddon was the thirteenth child of fourteen and sixth son of John Haddon, Printer and Publisher of London (1784-1855). Educated at University school, St. Paul's Churchyard, London, Thomas Robinson Haddon there happened to be a contemporary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> in his early school days. His father died when he was fifteen, but the home at Finsbury continued to be the centre of family interests and activity for many years. The sixties were great Colonising days for England, and Missionary work abroad was actively assisted by the Haddon family. Through the recommendation of a friend who had proceeded to Natal, he made the eventful plunge into Colonial life. At the age of twenty-two, accompanied by Walter Wheeler, he landed in Natal about 1862.</p>

  <p>In 1867 Mary Crowder, the daughter of an early settler from Devonshire, became the wife of Thomas Robinson Haddon, and thus commenced forty-five years of an ideal union. Those privileged to know intimately their family history through all its vicissitudes of varying fortune during nearly half a century, have frequently expressed the view that it stood for all that was best and truest in family life.</p>

  <p>Trading with the hinterland of North Natal and Transvaal was a part of the Durban business of Haddon and Wheeler and in 1870 Thomas Robinson Haddon made his home at Newcastle, in Natal. Here for the next fourteen years he had a prosperous and happy time, and his large family were nearly all born in Newcastle. His activities at this time led him to start a newspaper, the first published in the district. In 1894 he migrated to Johanessburg and lived there until his death.</p>

  <p>The following memoir appeared in the paper <em>South Africa</em>, on October 10, 1894, from the pen of Rev. John C. Harris, who was for many years Minister of the Congregational Church at Johannesburg and associated with Mr. Haddon in many committees and movements concerned with social and literary objects:</p>

  <p>&#8220;The chief product of South Africa is men. On wide veld and lonely kopje we have discovered gold and diamonds, but her greatest discoveries have always been men. &#8216;Successful men&#8217; we have called them. Men who have leaped from obscurity into sudden wealth or fame, flashed from mediocrity into romantic achievement in  commerce, in science , in state-craft, in finance. But after all, these men have not been the real Empire-builders. Our greatest debt to-day is not to capitalist nor statesman, warrior nor worker, but to the idealists, the interpreters, the men who made us see, beyond the glamour of the gold, and hear, above the clamour of the dorp, things which really make for a nation's life. T. R. Haddon was not, by common standards, a &#8216;successful&#8217; man. He had qualities of mind and soul which shut him out of the limelight. But he was one of the leavening forces which have served to purify colonial life, to widen its visions, to uphold its ideals, and give moral quality to its movements. Men have died for South Africa; he lived for her. Some have used South Africa as a stepping-stone to personal advancement or vulgar self-advertisement. He was one of those hidden hosts who flung soul and body down to be ploughed into her soil and enrich her for all the ages to come. How he loved South Africa, revelled in her beauty, wrestled with her problems, shared her crusts, and gloried in her future! Ah me! That we had more like him! I knew him in his home, in Johannesburg, a home which in that city of the Homeless gathered about it all the charm of an English fireside, and all the freedom of an African stoep. I knew him as a refugee in Durban in the dark days, keeping through all a gaiety of soul, and a sweetness of temper. I knew him amidst the hurly-burly of the Rand, and have found him, when he was Secretary of the Safe Deposit, watching over his treasure house, there ‘’tween chains,’ but revelling in Browning, or chanting Longfellow and Omar Khayyam! Over his head men watched the markets, and fought for ‘Wild Cats,’ but he jangled his magic keys to the music of the spheres, and was gloriously happy over a new book! Truly, as Kipling sings,</p>

  <blockquote cite="Rudyard%20Kipling">
    On the bones of the English,<br />
    The English Flag is stayed.
  </blockquote>

  <p>But surely it is no less on the hearts of the English, on their real culture of mind, and on their character-value. There for a life time, in a Land of Expediency, through days of darkened intrigue, in times of panic and passion, through years of drought and dread, of pestilence and many wars&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    he bore without reproach<br />
    The grand old name of Gentleman !
  </blockquote>

  <p>I wonder if he had any enemies! I think not, and yet he was not of the weak fraternity of smirk-makers who cannot hate. He wore the white flower, but never the white feather. the past few years brought him grief, and he was sore smitten by the arrows of bitter sorrow. But he wrote to me in the clanging words of W. E. Henley&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    In the fell clutch of Circumstance,<br />
    I have not winced nor cried aloud.
  </blockquote>

  <p>And now that he rests in the land he loved, and has ‘pass’d to where, beyond these voices there is peace,᾿ we wail no requiem, and cherish no grief. Such a maker of Empire-makers cannot die while the nation he helped to make lives. So I lay this tribute to his grave, and in words he often quoted from Browning’s ‘Grammarian’&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    Leave him&ndash;still loftier than the world suspects<br />
    Living and dying."
  </blockquote>
