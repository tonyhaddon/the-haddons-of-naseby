  <h1 id="heading_id_2">A Brief Account of John Haddon of Naseby and Clipston, 1744 - 1818.</h1>

  <p>JOHN HADDON, the third son of <a href="../Text/introduction.xhtml#flip">William</a> and Elizabeth Haddon of Naseby, was born there, and baptised on May 20th, 1744, at Naseby Church.</p>

  <p><img alt="" src="../Images/john-haddon-naseby.jpg" />As a young man he became attracted by the preaching of Mr. Coles, the Baptist Minister at the village of Long Buckby, and was admitted a member of the Baptist community there in 1769. When he drove the ten miles from Naseby to Long Buckby on Sundays, he was often the object of jeers and curses from irreligious folk as he passed through the villages on the road. Such treatment only stiffened his determination to follow the dictates of his conscience. In fact he regarded it as almost an honour to be insulted for his religious convictions.It is not recorded when he took a farm of his own at Naseby, but most likely he succeeded to his father's farm at his death in 1774. In 1778 he married Miss Elizabeth Clarke, whose family had long been resident at Market Harborough. His wife shared his religious views, and their twenty-one years of married life proved very happy. In 1782 John Haddon joined the Baptists of Clipston, a village between Naseby and Market Harborough, and soon became a Deacon there.</p>

  <p>After a time he obtained a licence to hold public worship in a part of his own house at Naseby, which he fitted up for the purpose. Among the Ministers who preached there was Mr. Carey of Moulton, Northants, who afterwards became the famous Indian Missionary. It was doubtless under his influence that Mr. Haddon was one of the earliest to subscribe to the Baptist Missions. Moreover, later on&mdash;about 1798&mdash;Mr. Haddon</p>

  <h2 id="heading_id_3">Missing Bit&mdash;John Haddon of naseby and clipston p 49a</h2>

  <p id="heading_id_3"><span class="sgc-5">this time that Mr. Haddon moved from the farm which&nbsp;</span>he had occupied so long, to the Manor Farm, Naseby. A&nbsp;view of the Manor House is here given. In its garden is the&nbsp;source of the Warwickshire Avon, inseparably connected&nbsp;with Shakespeare. Only a part of his former house now&nbsp;remains (1915), converted into a cottage and shop in High Street,&nbsp;Naseby, adjoining the Churchwardens Allotments. His stay&nbsp;at the Manor Farm was, however, comparatively short, for&nbsp;in 1815 he left Naseby for Clipston.&nbsp;There in the same year&nbsp;his son Benjamin married Miss&nbsp;Ann Brown of that Parish, and&nbsp;took a farm at Lubbenham, a&nbsp;few miles away.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_3">Mr. Haddon's health was now beginning to fail, and his&nbsp;latter years were saddened by&nbsp;the death, on October 14, 1816&nbsp;of his second daughter, Mary&nbsp;who had married in 1810 Mr.&nbsp;John Carryer of Leicester. After a long illness she&nbsp;succumbed to tuberculosis. She was a woman of beautiful&nbsp;character, as is shewn in the memoir of her, published by&nbsp;her brother, John Haddon, at&nbsp;his Press in Tabernacle Walk,&nbsp;London. There is appended to the memoir an appreciation&nbsp;of her from the pen of the Rev. Robert Hall, who had succeeded&nbsp;Dr. Carey as Minister of the Baptist Meeting House&mdash;as it was then called&mdash;in Harvey Lane, Leicester. When&nbsp;Mr. Haddon heard of her death, he said, "I shall soon be with&nbsp;her, and with Thomas, and with my dear wife." But he lived two&nbsp;years longer, and in 1817 saw his youngest son, Joseph, marry&nbsp;at Clipston, Miss Ruth Brown, a sister of Mrs. Benjamin Haddon.&nbsp;In the summer of 1818, Mr. Haddon's health grew much worse,&nbsp;and after two days' unconsciousness he passed away on&nbsp;September 2, 1818, and was buried beside his wife in Naseby&nbsp;Churchyard. There his slate tombstone stands today, with&nbsp;letters still clear cut, recording that he had reached the age&nbsp;74. The Baptist Magazine for June, 1819, contains a long&nbsp;memorial account of his life, from the pen of "J.M." of&nbsp;Clipston&mdash;the Rev. John Mack. the originator of the Birthday&nbsp;Scripture Text Book. This&nbsp;was reprinted in 1820 by his&nbsp;son Mr. John Haddon, and&nbsp;appended to it in the same&nbsp;booklet is the memoir of Mrs.&nbsp;Carryer. The chief notes&nbsp;of his character are there&nbsp;said to have been "peaceableness,&nbsp;Christian affection, humility and generosity." Besides these, he&nbsp;evidently possessed the gift&nbsp;of determination which has&nbsp;been so characteristic of the&nbsp;Haddon family.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_3">It remains to record that&nbsp;not long after his death, his&nbsp;youngest daughter, Elizabeth,&nbsp;became the third wife of her&nbsp;deceased sister's husband, Mr.&nbsp;John &nbsp;Carryer. This step was taken with the approval of&nbsp;the Rev. Robert Hall and the Deacons of the Harvey Lane&nbsp;Meeting House, Leicester. Her brother, Mr. John Haddon,&nbsp;not only approved, but actively aided by escorting his sister&nbsp;to Gretna Green, where the ceremony took place&mdash;such a&nbsp;marriage being then contrary to the laws of England. This&nbsp;brother became the most eminent of all the family, founding the&nbsp;Firm of John Haddon &amp; Co., in London, in 1814.</p>
