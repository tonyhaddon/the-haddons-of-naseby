  <p>Mr. Walter Haddon, in early youth, wished to follow the pursuit of Agriculture as his forefathers had for many generations, but circumstances ordained otherwise. In later life, he returned to Agriculture as a hobby, as a breeder of Hunters. In the year 1914, he was successful in taking the Premium 1st prize for Yearling Colts at the Hunter's Improvement Society held at the Agricultural Hall, London.
