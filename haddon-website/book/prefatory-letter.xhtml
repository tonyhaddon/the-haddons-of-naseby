  <h1 id="heading_id_2">Prefatory Letter</h1>

  <p id="heading_id_2"><span class="sgc-1">Dear Mr. Haddon,</span></p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">When you asked me to put together a history of your family, it was not anticipated by either of us that so many interesting facts would be brought to light, as has proved to be the case. Now that I present you with the result of my researches, my great regret is that it has not proved possible to link the Naseby Haddons with absolute certainty to any other branch of the very ancient and widespread family of Haddon.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">The difficulty is to ﬁnd the place of origin of your ancestor Richard Haddon, from whom all that are enumerated in this book can trace their descent. This Richard Haddon married Elizabeth But1in at Naseby in 1701. He must have been living here at the time, for otherwise he would have been described in the Church Register as belongin to some other parish. But it is impossible to say exactly how long he had been resident in the village. We know however that no Haddon occupied a house at Naseby when the Hearth Tax of 1673-4 was paid. Most likely he had settled in Naseby a year or two before his marriage.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">It is notoriously difficult to ﬁnd the place of origin of anyone in a case like this. It is just the same problem that so frequently baffles American genealogists. The late Colonel Chester, a most eminent genealogist, spent twenty years in a vain attempt to trace the English ancestors of President Washington. A family tradition stated that they came from Yorkshire, but ultimately they were found to belong to Northamptonshire. There has been a similar tradition in one part of your family Joh Haddon, your great-grandfather, and his brother William, came from Yorkshire. The Naseby Church Register, however, shows that that is just as unfounded as was the Washington tradition. They, like Washington's ancestors, hailed from Northamptonshire.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">In my long search for the place of origin of the Richard Haddon who married at Naseby in 1701, I have examined all the Haddon wills from 1650 to 1740 at Somerset House, Northampton, Peterborough, Lincoln, Lichfield and York, the Hearth Tax rolls, and other documents at the Public Record Office, various books and manuscripts at the British Museum and at the Diocesan Record Room, Peterborough, as well as the Church Registers of many parishes in Northamptonshire.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">I have found no less than ten Richard Haddons during that period. I have proved that most of these could not possibly be identical with your ancestor Richard Haddon of Naseby. One or two of these might possibly be he. For instance, there is a Richard Haddon who paid Hearth Tax at Northampton about 1671, and had left that town before the Hearth Tax of 1673-4 was paid. But he might equally well be the Richard Haddon who was having children at Walgrave by his wife Sarah, at the same period that your ancestor Richard was having children by his wife Elizabeth at Naseby, only ten miles from Walgrave, or the Richard of Naseby might have come from Spratton in Northants, as suggested at the end of the Introduction. In the absence of actual proof, I feel unable to put forward a deﬁnite identiﬁcation of your ancestor, Richard Haddon, with any of those whom I have found bearing the same name.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">If, however, my efforts have not been successful in tracing your ancestors with any certainty beyond the year 1701, nevertheless, I have ﬁrmly established your ancestry to that date. Two hundred years of reliable family history is by no means common. I should imagine that few Heads of Firms in the City of London can claim as much as that.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">Furthermore, my research has brought together many interesting facts about the numerous Haddons, who in many walks of life have done their duty in bygone centuries, and contributed no unworthy share to the building up of the national life of England.</p>

  <p id="heading_id_2">I have given you an outline of these achievements of the Haddon family in the Introduction to this volume. It only remains for me to add that in all my researches into the extensive history of the Haddons in past centuries, I have come across no fact which throws discredit on any bearer of that name. Such a record must prove an inspiration to the Haddons who are now growing up, and to those who shall follow in the time to come.</p>
