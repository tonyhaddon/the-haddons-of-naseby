THE HADDONS OF NASEBY

A book we have in my family for the last nearly 100 years (published 1915), detailing the history of my family. I'm working to make a digital copy out of it in epub format.

To zip and unzip, I'm using the instructions found at this link:
http://ebookconverting.com/zip-up-an-epub-on-a-mac. Thanks to Lisa. I'm preserving here in case this resource should go down.

Taking the below as your sample folder containing the epub:

cd desktop/epub_folder

If you are unzipping the folder, use this command:

unzip epubfilename.epub

(At this point, if you’re doing a fixed format file, you will put Apple’s display options file inside the META-INF folder. This is also the only way I know of to add audio and video files to an ePUB, and to make all the updates required to make these files work).

When you zip the ePub file back up, it’s important to zip an ePub up in the correct order. mimetype goes in first, with no compression. We’re also going to rename the file so we know we’re creating a new version. Here’s how:

zip -X newepubname.epub mimetype

Next up is the META-INF folder. You also want to suppress adding any MAC O/S .DS_Store files.

zip -rg newepubname.epub META-INF -x \*.DS_Store

Next is the OEBPS folder:

zip -rg newepubname.epub OEBPS -x \*.DS_Store

That’s it!
