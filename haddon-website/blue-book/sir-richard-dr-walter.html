  <h1 id="heading_id_2">An Account of Sir Richard Haddon and Dr. Walter Haddon.</h1>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">AFTER an apprenticeship to a London mercer named William Buzzard, Richard Haddon, son of a William Haddon, was admitted to the Mercers’ Company in 1473. Before 1482 he married as his first wife, Ann Byfield, daughter of Thomas Byfield, an Alderman of London. By her he had two sons, William, of whom more anon, and John, whose descendants in the male line, died out in the fifth generation. <i>(Stowe Mss. 624, p. 175-6. )</i> In 1496, Richard Haddon became a Warden of the Mercers’ Company, and also Sheriff of London. During his year of office he was knighted by King Henry VIII. for good service at Blackheath Field against the west country rebels, who had marched on London. He was master of the Mercers` Company in 1500, and again in 1508. In 1506 the king expressly ordered that he should be elected Lord Mayor of London, and he held that high position again for the latter part of 1512, upon the death of the Lord Mayor during his year of office.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">It is unknown when Sir Richard Haddon lost his first wife, and when he married, as his second wife, Katherine Wyndowt, widow of Thomas Wyndowt and daughter of Thomas Norland. By her he had three daughters. She was living at his death on October 1, 1517, and survived till 1524. <i>(See her will, P.C.C. 30, 30, Bodfelde.)</i> At the Inquisition taken after his death <i>(Chancery Series II,32,81)</i>, Sir Richard was found to own over 800 acres of land at Staverton, Northants, and 200 acres at West Haddon in the same County, besides land at Astall in Oxfordshire, and his country seat at S. Mary Cray, Kent, all of which he left to his widow for her life, and then to his son, William Haddon.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">Sir Richard Haddon, in his Will <i>(P.C.C. 29, Holder)</i>, desired to be buried "in the Parish Church of Saint Olave, in the Crowched Freres, where Dame Anne, my wife, lyeth." This is now called S. Olave’s, Hart Street, EC., and in it can be seen to-day a fine, though somewhat mutilated, brass to his memory (</span>A good photograph and description of it are given in The annals of the parish of St. Olave, Hart Street, published in 1894, by the Rev. A. Povah, then Rector.). The slab, with its brass, was lost at an unknown date, and accidentally discovered behind some wooden panelling early in 1846. <i>(Journal of the British Archaelogical Society 1846, pg. 58.)</i> It now stands against the wall of the south aisle of the Church. The brass figures represent Sir Richard Haddon's first wife, with her two sons, and his second wife with her three daughters. Above them are Latin texts on scrolls. Unfortunately the centre figure, representing Sir Richard himself, is missing. At the sides of the space which it occupied are two shields bearing the arms of his wives, and above is a larger shield with his own arms. There are also shields displaying the arms of the Merchants of the Staple, and those of the Mercers’ Company. The arms of Sir Richard are on a couche shield, surmounted by the helme of an esquire and a crest. Arms, a single hose; crest, or, a man’s leg in armour coupe at the thigh, foot upwards, toe to the dexter, spur on heel; all azure. This is the crest of the Haddons, including the Somersetshire branch, in ancient times, and shows that Sir Richard Haddon belonged to the old family of landowning Haddons, and was not of plebeian origin, for no one has any right to bear arms unless they have been granted to him, or to his direct ancestors.</p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">WILLIAM HADDON, the elder son of Sir Richard Haddon, married for his first wife Joan Wyndowt, a daughter of Thomas Wyndowt and his wife Katherine who was, or afterwards became, William Haddon’s stepmother. By her he had six children, and they and his wife ]oan were all living when Sir Richard Haddon made his Will on August 1, 1516. But Joan Haddon must have died not more than a year or two after this date, for before his death on May 10, 1521, William Haddon had had two sons, Walter and James, by his second wife, Dorothy Yonge. She belonged to a leading Worcestershire family long resident at Crome D’Abytot, in that County, and was a remarkable woman. More will be said of her in connection with her son, Dr. Walter Haddon. In the Inquisition that was taken after William Haddon's deat<i>h (Chancery Series IL, 42, 1691)</i>, he is described as being of the County of Bucks, but the place of his residence is apparently not now known. He was over thirty years old, and his heir was his son Thomas Haddon, to whom passed the right of inheriting the lands mentioned above, which his grandfather, Sir Richard Haddon, left to his widow Katherine for her life. Thomas Haddon was fourteen years old at his father's death, and when, or before, he came of age, he married Ursula Saunders, of Welford, Northants, and they and their descendants lived on their estate, originally bought by Sir Richard Haddon, at S. Mary Cray, Kent. Ultimately the estate was sold in the latter part of the 17th Century by Alexander Haddon, a direct descendant in the fifth generation of Thomas and Ursula Haddon. But we must now pass to Thomas Haddons famous half-brother, Walter Haddon.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">WALTER HADDON, as stated above, was the elder of the two sons of William Haddon by his second wife Dorothy, nee Yonge. He was born about 1518, and was therefore only about three years old when his father died in 1521. Some time before June, 1525, his mother married as her second husband, William Saunders of 'Welford, Northants. (I.P.M Exchequer Series II, 480, 12.) The boy Walter Haddon with his younger brother James would, no doubt, accompany their mother to her new home at the Manor House, Welford, a most interesting old house, which was afterwards the Talbot Inn. Welford is the next village west of Naseby, and it is an interesting reflection that Walter and James Haddon, in their boyhood, must often have visited Naseby, which nearly two centuries afterwards became the residence of the Haddons, of whom this book treats.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">Walter Haddon's mother was evidently a woman of education, for in the epithet which he wrote for her tomb he speaks of her as being a help and comrade to him in his work&mdash;"quae studiis adfuit una meis." <i>(W. Haddoni Poemata, I567.)</i> In her Will, dated October 12, 1572 <i>(P.C.C. 4, Martyn)</i>, she states that £350 had been spent in making this tomb in Lillingston Darrell Church, Bucks, during her lifetime. This sum is the equivalent of about £3,000 in modern money (1910). She chose Lillingston Darrell as her body's resting place, because her second husband, William Saunders, had died in 1540, and she had married as her third husband, Paul Dayrell, the owner of that Buckinghamshire village. In the chancel of its Church the tomb stands to-day, with lifesize effigies of Paul Dayrell and herself, and smaller figures of her thirteen children, and with her son Walter Haddon's Latin epitaph in good preservation. Her Will shows the greatness of her wealth, the generosity of her heart, and her love of learning. As a proof of the last quality, she leaves thirty pounds among thirty poor scholars at Oxford and Cambridge&mdash;"Such schollers as my executor shall thinke neede, and to be towardly in vertue and learning." But we must return to sketch the life of her famous son.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">Walter Haddon was sent to Eton, whence he matriculated at King's College, Cambridge, as Scholar, in 1533, and took his BA. in 1537, and his MA. in 1541. In 1549 he was elected to the high office of Vice-Chancellor of the University, and took his degree of LL.D. By this time he had become one of the shining lights of the Reformation at Cambridge. In February, 1551-2 he was appointed Master of Trinity Hall, and in September 1552, the Crown, on account of his Protestant views, forced him on Magdalen College, Oxford, as its President, in place of a President of Papal leanings. But in the following year Queen Mary came to the throne, Protestantism went under a cloud, and Dr. Haddon found it prudent to resign in favour of the former President.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sgc-2">When Queen Elizabeth succeeded her sister, Dr. Haddon came to the fore again. His Latin poem congratulatory of accession so greatly pleased the queen, herself an excellent Latin scholar, that she appointed him one of the Masters of the ancient</span> Court of Requests. In 1559, Dr. Haddon was selected by Archbishop Parker to be the Judge of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, which was the chief court in England for testamentary matters. The same year the queen granted him a pension of £50 a year, the equivalent of about £500 of modern money (1915); and in 1564, she gave the manor and lands of the former monastery of Wymondham, Norfolk, to him and his wife Margaret, a daughter of Sir John Clere, of Ormesby, in that county. His wife, however, did not live long to share in the enjoyment of the estate. On December 17, 1567, a licence was granted Dr. Haddon to marry as his second wife, Anne Sutton, daughter of Sir Henry Sutton, of Averham, Notts. <i>(London Marriage Licences. The Index Library.)</i></p>

  <p>Dr. Haddon's high favour at Court is illustrated not only by his sovereign's bounty towards him, but also by her famous reply to the question whether she preferred Dr. Haddon to Buchanan. In a sentence worthy of the Delphic Oracle the queen answered:</p>

  <p>"Buchananum omnibus antepono; Haddonum nemini postpono. "&mdash;" I place Buchanan before all; I place Haddon after none."</p>

  <p>Another story is related which shows that Queen Elizabeth's admiration for Dr. Haddon's abilities caused her to tolerate in him a brusqueness of manner which would probably have ruined any other courtier. The queen told him that his boots stank. "I believe," replied Dr. Haddon, "that it is not my new boots which stink, but my old petitions to you which have been so long unopened." These petitions may have been partly of a political nature, for Dr. Haddon added a parliamentary career to his other activities. He represented Reigate in 1555, Thetford in 1558, Poole 1559, and Warwick from 1563 to 1567. <i>(Alumni Oxonienses)</i> The queen employed him on several important political missions, sending him, on one occasion, as her envoy to Bruges. One of his poems expresses his delight with that beautiful city.</p>

  <p>Dr. Haddon frequently suffered from ill-health, as his poems and letters more than once testify. He died on Jan. 24th, 1570-1, and was buried in Christ Church, Newgate Street, London, where his tomb, with its Latin epitaph, was totally destroyed in the great fire of London in 1666. The words of the epitaph, however, are preserved in <i>Weever's Funeral Monuments, p. 391</i>. They speak of him as "a most celebrated lawyer, orator and poet; easily the first man of his time in Latin and Greek eloquence."</p>

  <p>In his Will <i>(I.P.M. 7 Holney)</i>, Dr. Haddon left to his only child, his son Clere, by his first wife, "all my books towards the furtherance of his study," and £200, besides the lands of which he was legally the heir. These included Wymondham, mentioned above, and the manors of Hatcham, Surrey, and East Greenwich, Kent. <i>(I.P.M. Chancery Series II 161, 120)</i>. The latter manor was worth £20 a year, the equivalent of about £200 of our money (1915). Clere Haddon, however, profited little by his father's books, money, or estates, for in the following May he was drowned in the Cam, at Cambridge, where he had lately become a Fellow of King's College. He was under 21 years of age and a bachelor, so that his estates passed to his heir at law, his mothers brother, Humphrey Yonge, of Crome D'Abytot, Worcestershire. No one can, therefore, trace their descent from Dr. Walter Haddon, but his fame as the most eminent Haddon in English history remains as a possession and inspiration to all Haddons.</p>

  <p>JAMES HADDON, the younger brother of Dr. Walter Haddon, was regarded as of equal mental ability, but his career was less prosperous. Like his brother, he was an alumnus of King's College, taking his B.A. in 1541-2 and his M.A. in 1544. In 1546 he was elected one of the original Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, which was founded in that year by Henry VIII. In 1551 he became chaplain to the Duke of Suffolk, and tutor to his daughter, the ill-fated Lady Jane Grey.</p>

  <p>On January 8th, 1552-3, James Haddon was nominated Dean of Exeter, but it is doubtful whether he was ever installed. As Dean&mdash;Designate, he took part in a famous debate upon sacramental questions, in the convocation of Canterbury, in October, 1553. In this he won a dialectical victory over Thomas Watson, afterwards Bishop of Lincoln. As a consequence he became a marked man among the Protestant party, and when Queen Mary came to the throne in the following year, he found it advisable to leave England for Strasburg, where he lived among the other exiled Reformers. He wrote from there in 1556, complaining of poverty, and died not long afterwards, but the exact date of his death is not known. His brother Walter wrote a touching epitaph in his memory.</p>
