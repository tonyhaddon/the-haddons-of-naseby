THE HADDONS OF NASEBY

A book we have in my family for the last nearly 100 years (published 1915), detailing the history of my family. I'm working to make a digital copy out of it in epub format.

Unless you know a better way, when working on the epub:

Use the shell script "/epub-fileset/compress-epub.sh" to combine the files into the-haddons-of-naseby.epub.

Work on it using an application such as Sigil, which can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/sigil/

When finished editing, re-extract the files using the "extract-epub.sh" script. Overwrite all.

This way, all edits are more granular and transparent.
