  <h1 id="heading_id_2">A Brief Account of Walter Haddon of Goulburn, N.S.W.</h1>

  <p>WALTER HADDON, the only son of the Rev. T. C. Haddon, Vicar of Tunstall, Norfolk, was born at Freethorpe, near Tunstall, on December 10, 1842. When a bright, brown-haired boy, he showed a great love of mechanics as well as of all outdoor pursuits, but little taste for books. Disliking a sea life, which he chose to follow for a time in early youth, he learnt engineering at Lincoln, and he then emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, in 1862.</p>

  <p><span class="img"><img alt="" src="../Images/walter-haddon-goulburn.jpg" /></span>There he obtained a post in the engineering department of a railway. An almost fatal fall from a railway bridge necessitated several months in hospital, where he made the acquaintance of Miss Lobb, who shortly afterwards became his admirable helpmeet in all ways for twenty years. Under her influence he took a more serious view of life, and became the right-hand helper of his clergyman. The eldest of their five sons was killed on the railway, and the blow hastened the death of his ailing mother.</p>

  <p>Mr. Walter Haddon then married again, only to lose his wife within two years. His third marriage brought him almost as much happiness as his first; but it was unfortunately a much briefer happiness, for he was cut off in 1902, at the age of 60, by the effects of a second serious fall combined with the results of his previous accident.</p>

  <p>Mr. Walter Haddon was a man of fine build, being six feet tall. He possessed sound judgment and much common sense. His bright nature made him a charming companion, and his stirling worth a valued friend.</p>
