  <h1 id="heading_id_2">A Brief Account of Thomas Haddon of Olney.</h1>

  <p>THOMAS HADDON, the youngest child of William and Sarah Haddon, of Hollowell, in the Parish of Guilsborough, Northants, was born there on June 1, 1775. This date rests on a written statement by his eldest son, the Rev. T. C. Haddon; for, unlike the elder children of William and Sarah Haddon, Thomas was not baptised at Guilsborough Church, because his parents had become Baptists about two years before his birth.</p>

  <p>Thomas Haddon attended Guilsborough village school called "The Writing School" to distinguish it from the Guilsborough Free Grammar School. The Headmaster was Thomas Comfield (1740 to 1825), the son of a Guilsborough farmer who lived to the patriarchal age of 93. He exceeded the average village school-master of that time in teaching ability. In his spare hours he taught arithmetic to children of County families. Among other pupils of his was Lady Georgina Spencer, who became "the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire." When Thomas Haddon had learnt all that he could at Guilsborough Writing School, he went to Northampton as pupil assistant to Thomas Comfield's son, Richard Comfield, who kept a private school in a line old house, now pulled down, in the Horse Market.</p>

  <p>There Thomas Haddon made such good progress that, in answer to an advertisement, he obtained a post of English master at Bedford Grammar School. But before he took up his duties there, he heard of an advantageous opening for a private school at Olney, Bucks. This he decided to seize, being desirous of having a home of his own in order to marry the daughter of his old schoolmaster, Thomas Comfield.</p>

  <p><span class="img"><img alt="" src="../Images/cowpers-house-olney.jpg" /></span>He took a house at Olney and opened his school. it succeeded so well that in a year's time he rented a larger house, which had been the residence of the poet Cowper, who had just died&mdash;April 27, 1800. At the sale of Cowper's effects, Mr. Haddon bought several pieces of furniture, including a mirror. His grand-daughters&mdash;the daughters of his eldest son, the Rev. T. C. Haddon&mdash;have since presented the mirror to the Cowper Museum, which is housed in the poet's old home at Olney&mdash;the right hand one of the two taller houses in the view here given.</p>

  <p>On September 9, 1800, Thomas Haddon married Elizabeth Comfield by Licence at Guilsborough Parish Church, and returned to Olney for a companionship with her of nearly forty-five years. His School flourished and increased, and so did his family. He therefore began to speak of moving to a place where he could have a still larger school. Some of the principal inhabitants of Olney begged him not to do so, and asked what would induce him to remain. He replied, "a small farm." This was found for him at Lavendon, two miles from Olney. For seven years he augmented his scholastic income by farming, for which he had inherited a distinct aptitude. At the end of that time, he was most shabbily deprived of his farm, except 16 acres which he had bought. He purchased 10 more acres, built a cottage for his labourer, and farmed successfully for some years. Then came a bad time for agriculture, the conclusion of the Napoleonic wars sending down the price of corn, and Mr. Thomas Haddon sold his farm. Some years later he tried sheep farming, but in a wet season that occurred the sheep died, and the venture ended disastrously. The School meantime was being continued successfully, and the old Baptist Manse in High Street, Olney, had been rented for a school -house. All went well till 1839, when his second son, Frederick Haddon, who assisted his father in the teaching and was a writer of some excellent verse, met with a tragical, though heroic, death. The present writer was fortunate enough to find an eye witness of the sad occurrence still alive in May, 1913, in the person of Mr. George Hollingshead of Olney, who gave the following vivid description of the accident :&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Several of us went to bathe in the Ouse on June I2, 1839. Mr. Frederick Haddon stood on the bank, holding a watch in his hand to check the time that we were allowed to remain in the water. One of my fellow-pupils, named Morgan, got out of his depth, and being unable to swim, was in great danger. Mr. Frederick Haddon thereupon walked into the river in his clothes, still holding the watch in his hand above his head. When he got into fairly deep water, he suddenly disappeared, and I saw him no more - only his hat floating on the surface. At that point there is a shelf in the river, below which the writer is very deep, and Mr. Frederick Haddon must have unknowingly stepped off it into the deep water. Probably his feet stuck fast in the mud at the bottom, for he never rose again. We boys, of course, raised an alarm, but when help came it was too late to save our beloved master. The lad Morgan was rescued by some of the boys who could swim. It was by far the most calamitous occurrence of my boyhood. It so much upset me that l did not sleep one minute for three or four nights afterwards. I still remember it as distinctly as if it had happened yesterday."
  </blockquote>

  <p>A short corroborative account of the tragedy is to be found in The Northamption Mercury of Saturday, June 15th, 1839. Mr. Frederick Haddon was buried in the graveyard attached to the Baptist Chapel at Olney, which his father had attended, though without becoming an actual member, ever since he settled in the town.</p>

  <p>Mr. Thomas Haddon seems never to have recovered from the loss that he thus sustained. He must, however, have found some comfort in the prosperity of his other sons. In the same year, his eldest son, the Rev. Thomas Comfield Haddon, was appointed Vicar of Tunstall, Norfolk. His third son, Richard, had three years before made a socially good marriage with Miss M. C. Wykes, daughter of the late Rev. James Wykes, Rector and Squire of Hazelbeech, an adjoining parish to Naseby, the old home of the Haddons. His fourth son, William had gone up to the University of Cambridge. But these facts could only alleviate in a small degree. There can be little doubt that the tragedy shortened Mr. Thomas Haddon's life. He gave up the school shortly afterwards, and spent his last years in retirement at Olney, where he died on April 25, 1845, at the age of three score years and ten. He was buried in the same grave as his son, Frederick, and there, too, fifteen years later his widow was laid to rest. A recumbent gravestone marks the spot with this inscription&mdash;</p>

  <p>" In memory of Thomas Haddon, who died April 25, 1845, aged 70 years,<br />
  And of Eliza, his wife, who died February II, 1860, aged 81 years;<br />
  Also of Frederick Haddon, son of the above, who died June 12, 1839, aged 36 years."</p>

  <p>The life of Mr. Thomas Haddon was clearly one of great diligence and perseverance. He is described by Mr. Hollingshead of Olney as "a fine looking man, rather thick set." His mental ability was evidently very considerable, and his strength of character such as to impress itself on his pupils. In his wife he seems to have had an excellent helpmeet. Mr. Hollingshead described her as "rather a little woman, and active in her habits." It was no doubt from her, as well as from Mr. Haddon, that their children and grandchildren inherited the intellectual gifts, which they have displayed in tuition, journalism and art.</p>
