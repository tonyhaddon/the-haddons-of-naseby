  <h1 id="heading_id_2">Notes about Haddons in various Counties.</h1>

  <p>IN RUTLAND there was a family of gentry named Haddon, who coming from Braseburgh, Lincolnshire, settled at Essendine in Rutland <i>(Visitation Of Rutland, Harleian Society, vol. III)</i>. This family remained at Essendine through the 17th and 18th centuries as shown by the Wills, at the Peterborough Probate Registry, of Deborah Haddon in 1703, Charles Haddon in 1743, and Elizabeth Haddon in 1766. Members of this family settled in other villages in the county a Joseph Haddon, at Braunston, whose Will dated 1684 shows him to have possessed considerable wealth. The Rev. Roger Haddon, who died Rector of Casterton Parva, in 1641, was probably a member of this branch. If so, he kept up the family's connection with Lincolnshire by choosing both his wives from Dowsby, in that county, <i>(Marriage Licences at Lincoln, in the Index Library)</i>. But he may have been a native of Dowsby, where a Yeoman family of Haddons was living at that period.</p>

  <p>In WARWICKSHIRE we find numerous Haddons in its eastern part, adjacent to Northamptonshire, whence, doubtless, they came. They were nearly all agriculturists. The wills of about a dozen of them are preserved at Lichfield. It is an interesting fact that a Thomas Haddon of Willey in this county moved to Sibbertoft, the next parish to Naseby, about 1673. <i>(The Correction Book for 1681 in the Diocesan Record Room, Peterborough.)</i> There he became Churchwarden and left a good fortune to his sons, Thomas, Daniel and Joseph. <i>(See his Will at Somerset House, Sept. 13, 1728.)</i> But there is no connection, apparently, between him and the Naseby Haddons. Another Warwickshire Haddon who succeeded in life was Peter Haddon, son of John Haddon, Yeoman of Woolston, near Rugby. He took his B.A. at Oxford in 1677, became Vicar of his native parish in 1680, and of Bolton le Moors, I.ancashire, in 1691. <i>(See Foster's Alumni Oxonienses.)</i> This family seems to have been connected with Northamptonshire, for John Haddon of Woolston certified the presentation of Daniel Walsh to the Rectory of St. Sepulchre's, Northampton, on November 27, 1657. (<i>R. M. Serjeantson's History of St. Sepulchre's, p. 157.)</i> Furthermore in Shakespeare's town the Haddons were represented. A William Haddon was living there in Shakespeare's life-time. <i>(See the Stratford-0n-Avon Register, p. II, printed by the Parish Register Society.)</i> There are still many Haddons in this county.</p>

  <p>LEICESTERSHIRE had numerous Haddons, especially on its Northamptonshire side, from early times. In 1487 a John Haddon owned a messuage in the town of Market Harborough, in which to-day his namesake-Firm of John Haddon &amp; Co. has its world-famous Type Foundry. (Stocks Market Harborough Records, p. 193.) In the 16th and 17th centuries Haddons were to be found at Bosworth, Burbage, Enderby and other places in this county. <i>(Leicestershire Wills, 1495-.1649, in the Index Library.)</i></p>

  <p>BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, besides being the native county of Dr. Walter Haddon, was the home of several Haddons at Newport Pagnell. They are described as "Gentlemen," and so were people of some position and substance.</p>

  <p>BERKSHIRE seems to have possessed few Haddons. There was, however, a Michael Haddon, a prosperous brewer of Windsor, who died in 1694, leaving a son Richard, whose son was named Michael.</p>

  <p>OXFORDSHIRE furnishes a quota of Haddons, who probably originated from the place Haddon in the parish of Bampton in this county. An early Haddon of Oxfordshire is mentioned below under Bedfordshire. In 1516, Sir Richard Haddon, of London, possessed land at Astall, in Oxfordshire, where his younger son John is said to have lived and left descendants who died out in the male line in the fifth generation <i>(Stowe Mss., 624, p. 175-6)</i>, but we doubt this descent. There was a Richard Haddon, alias Smith, of Kingham, who died in 1681 <i>(See his Will at Somerset House, 135 North)</i>, leaving an eldest son Richard.</p>

  <p>At Tackley there were also many Haddons, alias Smith, in the 16th and 17th centuries. It would seem probable that it was a branch of these Oxfordshire Haddons, alias Smith, who settled at Charlton, near Newbottle, just across the Northamptonshire border. <i>(See the Will of Bridget Haddon, alias Smith, of Charlton, Dec. 1, 1590, at Somerset House, 3 Sainberfe.)</i> There they afterwards dropped the alias "Smith" and were a prosperous yeoman family down to modern times. Their house has been bought and modernised by Sir F. E. Smith in very recent years. In Oxford itself was a Thomas Haddon, whose son John became Rector of Warrington, Lancashire, from 1723 till his death in 1766. His son, Peter Haddon, was Vicar of Sandbach, Cheshire, in 1775, and Surrogate of the Archbishop of York's Probate Court in 1799.</p>

  <p>BEDFORDSHIRE contained a family of Haddons at Dunstable, who held a leading position in the town from at least 1550, when the Church Register there begins. They were possibly descendants of William Haddon of the County of Oxford, whom Thomas, the Prior of Dunstable, when about to "go beyond the seas," nominated his attorney in England for the space of one year, from September 2, 1360. <i>(The Patent Roll for 1360.)</i> It is perhaps worth remarking that about the year 1810 John Haddon, the founder of John Haddon &amp; Co., renewed the name Haddon in Dunstable by living there for a few years.</p>

  <p>HERTFORDSHIRE. In Hertford itself there was a Francis Haddon, a Quaker, who for his faith suffered imprisonment from 1664 to 1672. (<i>Besse's Sufferings of the Quakers, vol. I, p. 248.)</i> He died in 1679, apparently unmarried. <i>(See his Will at Somerset House, 143 King.)</i></p>

  <p>ESSEX contained many Haddons, who probably overflowed thither from London. There was, for instance, a Richard Haddon of Barking, Gentleman, who died in 1655. <i>(See his Will at Somerset House, 254 Aylett.)</i> At Woodford was another Richard Haddon, whose son William was appointed Administrator of his estate on April 30, 1660. <i>(Admon, Act Book at Somerset House.)</i> In the same year Samuel Haddon of Chingford left his freehold land to his son Abraham Haddon. <i>(See his Will at Somerset House, 5 Laud.)</i> In the next century we find at Stapleford Tawney tombstones of Haddons described as "citizens of London."</p>

  <p>KENT. In the 15th century Haddons occupied prominent positions at Sandwich. That town returned representatives, called Barons, to Parliament. Among them were Robert Haddon, chosen Baron in 1410, Thomas Haddon in 1436, John Haddon in 1441, and Thomas Haddon in 1446, 1448 and 1449. <i>(Hors!ed's History of Kent, vol. IV.,p. 262.)</i> These were quite a distinct family from Sir Richard Haddon and his descendants at S. Mary Cray in the 16th and 17th centuries, of whom an account has already been given.</p>

  <p>SUSSEX had its share of Haddons. Thus an Alexander Haddon of East Grinstead in 1647 obtained a licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury's Faculty Office to marry a Martha Pickering&mdash;a name which, curiously enough, a sister of the Founder of John Haddon &amp; Co. bore after her marriage. <i>(See page 48.)</i> There were also Haddons at Hastings in the 16th century. <i>(Sussex Wills, in the Index Library.)</i></p>

  <p>SOMERSETSHIRE has been the home of numerous Haddons from the time of Henry Haddon in 1256, the great grandfather of the Sir Henry Haddon of Isle Brewers, who has been already mentioned, down to the present day. Some of these Haddons owned land also in Dorset in early times. <i>(Hutchin's History of Dorset, Vol. HL, p. 665.)</i> Possibly to this family belonged Henry of Haddon and Richard of Haddon, who about the year 1250 witnessed a grant to the Church of Culintum, now spelt Colynton, in Devonshire. <i>(Historical MSS. Comission, Dean and Chapter of Exeter's MSS. vol. IV., p. 67.)</i></p>

  <p>WORCHESTERSHIRE supplies us with a settlement of Haddons at Rowley, including a Richard Haddon who died in 1612. <i>(Worcestershire Will's in the Index Library.)</i></p>

  <p>NOTTINGHAMSHIRE gives us an Elizabeth Haddon at Caythorpe in the parish of Lowdham in 1683, and a George Haddon at Gotham in 1705. The Wills of both these are at the York Probate Registry.</p>
